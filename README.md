# Harris Center Lifeline Calls Analysis

Data Overview
As a personal project, I was curious to see what the data for the suicide prevention lifeline for my hometown was. Some questions I had in mind were, how many calls did they recieve? How much staff were there to handle the calls? What's the average waiting time? And so on...

Thus, I made a records request [here](https://www.theharriscenter.org/Public-Information-Request) and requested all their call data.

I received several files, and one in specific included the following data by columns:
• Month	Received
• Abandoned
• Handled
• Avg Wait Time in queue
• Answer Rate
• Line
• Annual Rcvd
• Annual Aband
• Annual Handled
• Annual Answer Rate
• Staffing

I made a short analysis [here](https://github.com/dv7jose/Harris-Center-Lifeline-Calls-Analysis/blob/main/Harris_Center_Analysis.ipynb) and plan on adding more throughout the months.

This was good practice on making records requests and following up with the center, data cleaning, analysis, and visualization through pandas and altair.
